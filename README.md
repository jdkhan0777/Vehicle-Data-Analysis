Car Sales Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes used car sales data using SQL. The dataset contains various attributes such as car name, manufacturing year, selling price, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission type, and ownership history. SQL queries are used to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
________________________________________
Dataset
The dataset consists of used car listings with the following key attributes:
•	Car Name – The name/model of the car.
•	Year – Manufacturing year of the car.
•	Selling Price – The price at which the car is listed for sale.
•	Kilometers Driven – The total distance the car has been driven.
•	Fuel Type – Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, etc.).
•	Seller Type – Whether the seller is an individual or a dealer.
•	Transmission – Manual or Automatic transmission.
•	Ownership – Indicates whether the car is a first-owner, second-owner, etc.

Technologies Used
•	SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
•	pgAdmin for database management

Approach
1.Data Preprocessing:
•	Imported the dataset into PostgreSQL using the COPY command.
•	Cleaned the data by handling missing values and duplicates.
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Checked the distribution of fuel types, seller types, and ownership history.
•	Identified potential pricing trends based on car attributes.
________________________________________
Results
•	The majority of used cars in the dataset are manual transmission.
•	Diesel cars have a higher average selling price than petrol cars.
•	Most used cars listed for sale are first-owner cars.
•	The most expensive car in the dataset is priced significantly higher than the average.

How to Use
1.Import the dataset into PostgreSQL:
COPY car_details FROM 'D:/path/to/file.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
2. Run SQL queries in PostgreSQL or pgAdmin.
3. Analyze trends in car pricing, fuel type, and seller behavior.

Future Improvements
Expand the dataset with more recent car listings.
Create a dashboard in Power BI or Tableau for better visualization.
Optimize queries for faster data retrieval in large datasets.
